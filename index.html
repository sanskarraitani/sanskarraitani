    <h3>CoinCollect</h3>
    <p>
	My java programming project, concluding the Java Programming Module at 
	City (2021). This Java project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of game engine libraries,objects, inheritance
    GUI or the graphical user interface game, sound, game collisions
    and many more. this is a one player game and the main objective of 
    the game is to collect coins and kill enemies passing onto the next level. We need to use the 
    amount of jetpack fuel given to complete the level which makes it harder.
